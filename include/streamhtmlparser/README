This directory contains an implementation of an html context scanner with no
lookahead. Its purpose is to scan an html stream and provide context
information at any point within the input stream. An example of a user of this
scanner would be an auto escaping templating system, which would require
html context information at very specific points within the html stream. The
implementation is based on a simplified state machine of HTML4.1.
