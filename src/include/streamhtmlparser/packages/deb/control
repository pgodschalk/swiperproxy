Description: Implementation of an html context scanner with no lookahead. Its
  purpose is to scan an html stream and provide context information at any point
  within the input stream. An example of a user of this scanner would be an auto
  escaping templating system, which would require html context information at
  very specific points within the html stream. The implementation is based on a
  simplified state machine of HTML4.1.
